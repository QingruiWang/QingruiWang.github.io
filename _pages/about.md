My name is Qingrui Wang, and I am currently a lecturer at the School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China. My research focuses on the intersection of renewable energy development and environmental protection. I have expertise in geographic information systems (GIS), machine learning, remote sensing, and related technologies. I welcome all opportunities for academic collaboration in these fields.
