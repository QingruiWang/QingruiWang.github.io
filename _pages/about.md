My name is Qingrui Wang, and I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China. My research focuses on the intersection of renewable energy development and environmental protection. I have expertise in geographic information systems (GIS), machine learning, remote sensing, and related technologies. I welcome all opportunities for academic collaboration in these fields.
